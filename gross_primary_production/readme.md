### MODIS/Aqua Net Primary Production Yearly L4 Global 500 m data process

The MYD17A3H Version 6 product provides information about annual Net Primary Production (NPP) at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. Annual NPP is derived from the sum of all 8-day Net Photosynthesis (PSN) products (MYD17A2H) from the given year. The PSN value is the difference of the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and the Maintenance Respiration (MR).

With this notebook, you can download the global scale data, create mosaic and convert the data to epsg:4326.

You can arrange "year_list" variable according your time range.
